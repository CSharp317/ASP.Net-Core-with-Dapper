Using ASP.NET Core's built-in dependency injection, I registered `EmployeeRepository` as the concrete implementation of `IEmployeeRepository`. `EmployeeRepository` implements the abstract class `SqlGenericRepository`. The plan is for `SqlGenericRepository` to contain all the CRUD repository methods, while `IEmployeeRepository` is reserved for any Employee specific repo functions.  I tried using this architecture in other projects. The realworld has changed my thoughts on how I designed this. `SqlGenericRepository` is annoying to implement when you want a lightweight repository or unique customizations. Ultimately, I changed `SqlGenericRepository` to `SqlRepository`, with it only having the responsibility of opening the SQL Connection. Any concrete repository that uses SQL as a data store extends `SQLRepository`.
